## How Autoencoders Outperform PCA in Dimensionality Reduction
Dimensionality reduction is crucial for many machine learning tasks, from speeding up model training and reducing computational cost to mitigating the curse of dimensionality and enabling data visualization.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used, efficient linear technique. Autoencoders, a type of neural network, offer a more powerful, non-linear approach. Let's explore why and how autoencoders can capture more complex data structures than PCA, particularly when using a dataset like MNIST.
